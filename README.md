#### Stakeholders and Customers Research
Stakeholders and customers are essential in identifying and shaping the application opportunities, whether in terms of the scalability aspects, market adoption or the overall feasibility, their insight will refine the features of the application ensuring it will align with the current industry needs. Therefore an analysis of  potential customers and a well-constructed methodology to approach them is required to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences.

Table 1 illustrates the potential customers and stakeholders for the application which are mainly within the real estate industries such as real estate agents, property developers and home buyers and sellers. The justification on why these groups in particular is due to their direct involvement and potential for them to subscribe to the product for instance the purpose for real estate agents to use the product may be to identify market trends, whereas property developers may be to compare the price between different areas. Nonetheless, these groups share commonalities the need for accurate real estate valuation and data driven decision making, both of which the product is able to provide. 

In addition, the combination of semi-structured interview and online surveys are an effective methodoloigies to approach these customers due to that it offers both qualitative and quantitative data that will drive the development of the product. For instance, data from semi-structured interviews allow the understanding of the customer specific needs and expectation which could differentiate the product from competitors. While online surveys allow for a wider reach of quantifiable data on user preferences and potential adoption rates. 

Table 1. Stakeholder Analysis and Potential Approach Methodologies 
| Stakeholder   | Purpose        | Engagement Method | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------------|
| Real Estate Agents  | Identify pricing factors and market trends| Semi-structure Interview |
| Property Developers  | Identify and compare the price in specific areas and forecasts the price in multiple locations| Online Survey | 
| Home Buyer and Seller | Improve their decision making through the use of the application | Online survey |

Figure 1 demonstrates a power/interest grid which is a matrix used to identify and categorise stakeholders based on their influence and interest in a project. Real estate agents and Property developers would fall within high power and interest due to that they actively based investment decisions on the market trends, suggesting that their engagement is important to ensure that the product aligns with the current needs of the industry. Whereas, home buyers and sellers would fall within another spectrum of high interest but lower power because although they may be the direct users of the product but their influence to shape the market are lesser than real estate agents and property developers.

- Real Estate Agencies and Partnerships: Collaborations with London-based real estate agencies can provide access to exclusive data or insights, potentially through revenue-sharing agreements or data access contracts. This might involve negotiation costs but can enhance data quality and competitiveness.

Acquisition Strategy: Data will be purchased from property portals for real-time insights, supplemented by free historical data from HM Land Registry, with potential partnerships to access detailed or localized data, ensuring comprehensive coverage for London’s dynamic market.


#### Marketing Resources
To reach target customers—real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers/sellers—the business needs effective marketing channels. The plan suggests a B2C approach with subscription models, indicating a need for customer acquisition strategies.
Acquisition Strategy: Marketing channels will be developed through digital strategies, including social media campaigns, content marketing on real estate blogs, and email marketing. Participation in industry conferences and partnerships with real estate associations will enhance visibility, as seen in successful real estate tech startups [Built In NYC](https://www.builtinnyc.com/articles/nyc-real-estate-startups-to-know).

### What are the main risks to the success of your business and how will you address or mitigate them?
The team conducted a PESTLE analysis to identify external factors that may hinder the success of the business.

| Category       | Description  |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Political**  | - The government may impose restrictions on foreign investors purchasing real estate. <br> - Government urban development policies could disrupt AI-based price predictions. <br> - Strengthened immigration restrictions may reduce housing demand in urban areas. <br> - International conflicts may lead investors to withdraw from the market. |
| **Economic**   | - Rising interest rates may increase home-buying costs and lead to declining property prices. <br> - The expansion of remote work may increase property prices in suburban areas. <br> - Economic downturns may drive demand for real estate as a safe-haven asset. |
| **Social**     | - Demand for rental properties may increase over home purchases. <br> - New investment methods (e.g., real estate tokenization) may attract more investors. <br> - Public perception of AI-driven decision-making in real estate. <br> - People's concerns about remote real estate transactions. <br> *(If major fraud cases occur, it could damage the brand's reputation.)* |
| **Technological** | - Real estate tokenization (Failure to adapt may result in losing market competitiveness). <br> - Increasing cybersecurity risks *(Personal data leaks, fraud, hacking of payment systems, blockchain vulnerabilities).* <br> - Growing attention to PropTech → More competitors entering the market. *(Risk of AI prediction programs/systems being copied).* <br> - The accuracy of AI-driven predictions remains uncertain. |
| **Legal**      | - Compliance with GDPR and personal data protection regulations. <br> - The need to ensure transparency and accountability in AI-based prediction models. *(Depending on how it is used, it could be classified as market manipulation).* <br> - Legal risks associated with cross-border transactions and foreign investors. <br> - Potential introduction of new regulations governing AI usage. |
| **Environmental** | - Climate change, natural disasters, and pandemics may lower demand in specific areas. |

### Analysis of Key Business Risks Based on PESTLE Findings

(We will select one of the risks below and provide a detailed discussion, including Mitigation & Contingency Plans.)

**Talent Shortage**
Our business relies heavily on high-value online transactions and foreign investors, requiring robust payment systems and extensive legal and tax-related operations.
A lack of expertise in cybersecurity and legal compliance could lead to regulatory fines and reputational risks.
Additionally, startups face challenges in attracting top talent, making it difficult to secure professionals with specialized knowledge.

**Acquiring the First Customers**
Without acquiring early adopters, the business may fail to gain traction, leading to financial constraints.
Since trust is critical in the real estate industry, a lack of brand recognition could make potential customers hesitant to use the platform.

**Technology Imitation by Competitors**
AI-driven real estate investment tools are gaining attention, and more companies are expected to enter the market.
AI technologies are relatively easy to replicate, making it difficult to establish sustainable competitive differentiation.

**Fraud and Technical Errors Leading to Loss of Trust**
If fraudulent activities occur, the brand’s credibility will be severely impacted, leading to customer attrition.
There is a risk that fraudulent property listings or malicious users could exploit the system, further damaging trust and reputation.
