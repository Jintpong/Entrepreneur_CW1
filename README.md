#### What relevant secondary research did you find?
1. Overview of the London Housing Market
Recent data from the London Housing Market Report highlights key trends indicating increased market activity. A shifting balance between new buyer inquiries and property listings suggests greater engagement within the market. Since 2023, the number of available rooms for house shares has been steadily increasing, although demand for rented rooms has fluctuated.

1.1 Market Demand and Supply
The accompanying chart from RICS survey data illustrates monthly changes in buyer inquiries and newly listed homes in London. Market demand experienced growth in the last quarter, coinciding with the Bank of England’s first interest rate cut since May 2022. As a second rate cut is expected, this trend is likely to continue. Additionally, seller activity has increased, leading to the first net-positive market activity since 2022.

1.2 Projections for 2025
Rightmove anticipates that the number of homes for sale will remain high in the coming year, maintaining strong competition among sellers and preventing significant price increases. However, this increased supply is expected to facilitate more transactions, with Rightmove projecting approximately 1.15 million completed sales in 2025.

1.3 Impact of Stamp Duty Changes
An upcoming reduction in the stamp duty threshold, set to take effect on April 1, could add thousands of pounds in moving costs for buyers. Rightmove's real-time data has already detected a surge in first-time buyer activity in high-cost areas as they attempt to finalize purchases before the new rates apply. Nevertheless, many regions in England still offer homes under the £300,000 threshold, allowing first-time buyers to benefit from significant tax advantages compared to second-home buyers.
Currently, the number of first-time buyers actively engaging with agents is 13% higher than the same period last year. With affordability expected to improve and rents continuing to rise, strong activity in this segment is anticipated throughout 2025.

2. The Role of AI in Real Estate
Two years after the release of ChatGPT, AI has become a transformative force across industries, including finance, manufacturing, healthcare, education, and real estate. Even real estate, a traditionally slow adopter of technology, is beginning to integrate AI for enhanced decision-making, task automation, cost reduction, and improved customer service.
According to JLL's 2023 Global Real Estate Technology Survey, AI and generative AI were ranked among the top three technologies expected to have the greatest impact on real estate over the next three years. The industry has amassed vast amounts of proprietary and third-party data, which is now being leveraged to develop AI-driven systems tailored to real estate-specific tasks.

2.1 AI Applications in Real Estate
2.1.1 Listing Descriptions
Writing property listing descriptions is traditionally a manual and time-consuming process. However, generative AI is transforming this by creating descriptions that are not only unique and compelling but also optimized for SEO positioning. Tools like ListingAI generate high-quality property descriptions in seconds, saving time and costs for real estate agents.

2.2 Property Evaluation
Estimating the true market value of a property is complex, as it depends on numerous factors, including location, asset features, demographic shifts, and environmental risks. AI-driven machine learning models now analyze large datasets to produce valuations that reflect real-time market conditions rather than broad estimates.
For example, StadimData has developed an AI-powered platform that collects real estate data and automatically predicts property values, enhancing accuracy in asset evaluation.

2.3 Real Estate Investment
AI and predictive analytics are revolutionizing investment decision-making in real estate. Advanced machine learning models process granular data, including location, property condition, market demand, economic indicators, and even social media sentiment. Major firms like BlackRock leverage these AI models to gain deeper insights into property values and identify investment opportunities at a global scale.

3. Conclusion
The London housing market is experiencing a positive shift in buyer activity and seller engagement, driven by interest rate cuts and changing market dynamics. The anticipated stamp duty changes and sustained supply levels are expected to shape market behavior in 2025. Meanwhile, AI is transforming real estate through automated property descriptions, improved asset valuation, and data-driven investment strategies. As AI adoption continues to grow, its influence on the real estate sector will expand, leading to greater efficiency and accuracy in market transactions.

#### Stakeholders and Customers Research
Stakeholders and customers are essential in identifying and shaping the application opportunities, whether in terms of the scalability aspects, market adoption or the overall feasibility, their insight will refine the features of the application ensuring it will align with the current industry needs. Therefore an analysis of  potential customers and a well-constructed methodology to approach them is required to gain a deeper understanding of their needs and preferences.

Table 1 illustrates the potential customers and stakeholders for the application which are mainly within the real estate industries such as real estate agents, property developers and home buyers and sellers. The justification on why these groups in particular is due to their direct involvement and potential for them to subscribe to the product for instance the purpose for real estate agents to use the product may be to identify market trends, whereas property developers may be to compare the price between different areas. Nonetheless, these groups share commonalities the need for accurate real estate valuation and data driven decision making, both of which the product is able to provide. 

In addition, the combination of semi-structured interview and online surveys are an effective methodoloigies to approach these customers due to that it offers both qualitative and quantitative data that will drive the development of the product. For instance, data from semi-structured interviews allow the understanding of the customer specific needs and expectation which could differentiate the product from competitors. While online surveys allow for a wider reach of quantifiable data on user preferences and potential adoption rates. 

Table 1. Stakeholder Analysis and Potential Approach Methodologies 
| Stakeholder   | Purpose        | Engagement Method | 
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------------|
| Real Estate Agents  | Identify pricing factors and market trends| Semi-structure Interview |
| Property Developers  | Identify and compare the price in specific areas and forecasts the price in multiple locations| Online Survey | 
| Home Buyer and Seller | Improve their decision making through the use of the application | Online survey |

Figure 1 demonstrates a power/interest grid which is a matrix used to identify and categorise stakeholders based on their influence and interest in a project. Real estate agents and Property developers would fall within high power and interest due to that they actively based investment decisions on the market trends, suggesting that their engagement is important to ensure that the product aligns with the current needs of the industry. Whereas, home buyers and sellers would fall within another spectrum of high interest but lower power because although they may be the direct users of the product but their influence to shape the market are lesser than real estate agents and property developers.

## Strategy plan 


### What is your legal status and structure of your Business? 

Choosing the appropriate legal structure for our business is critical as it determines liability, taxation, and operational flexibility. Below are the main options in the UK, along with their costs and considerations:

#### 1. Sole Trader
- **Description**: A sole trader operates as a self-employed individual. They retain all profits after tax but are personally liable for all debts.
- **Cost**: No registration fee with Companies House; however, you must register with HMRC for self-assessment. 
- **Advantages**: Simple setup, low cost, complete control.
- **Disadvantages**: Unlimited personal liability and limited growth potential. [[1]](https://xactaccountants.co.uk/blog/companies-house-fees-changes/), [[2]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z74mmfr/revision/3)

#### 2. Partnership
- **Description**: A partnership involves two or more individuals sharing management, profits, and liabilities.
- **Cost**: No Companies House registration required; partners must register with HMRC for self-assessment which typically requires a solicitor and can cost anywhere from £500 to several thousand pounds depending on complexity. Without such an agreement, the Partnership Act 1890 applies by default. [[3]](https://www.gardandco.com/what-we-do/business-law/business-articles/sole-trader-partnership-or-limited-company-2/)
- **Advantages**: Shared responsibility and expertise.
- **Disadvantages**: Joint liability for debts and potential conflicts between partners. [[1]](https://xactaccountants.co.uk/blog/companies-house-fees-changes/), [[2]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z74mmfr/revision/3)

#### 3. Limited Liability Company (Ltd.)
- **Description**: A private company where owners' liability is limited to their investment in shares.
- **Cost (as of may 2024)**:
  - Online registration: £50
  - Same-day online registration: £78
  - Paper registration: £71. [[4]](https://lawhive.co.uk/knowledge-hub/small-business/how-much-does-it-cost-to-register-a-business-in-the-uk/), [[5]](https://whittakerandco.com/companies-house-registration-fees-set-to-increase/), [[6]](https://fcls.co.uk/companies-house-fees-increasing-from-1-may-2024/), [[7]](https://osome.com/uk/guides/business-registration-costs/), [[8]](https://www.brearleyandco.co.uk/news/business-news/companies-house-increases-registration-fees), [[9]](https://www.1stformations.co.uk/blog/companies-house-filing-fees-increase/)
- **Ongoing mandatory costs include:**
   - Annual confirmation statement: £34 online or £62 paper 
   - Company name changes (if needed): £20 online or £30 paper
   - Voluntary dissolution (when closing): £33 online or £44 paper. [[6]](https://fcls.co.uk/companies-house-fees-increasing-from-1-may-2024/), [[8]](https://www.brearleyandco.co.uk/news/business-news/companies-house-increases-registration-fees), [[9]](https://www.1stformations.co.uk/blog/companies-house-filing-fees-increase/)
- **Taxation Framework**
   - Limited companies pay corporation tax on profits (currently 19% for small profits and 25% for profits over £250,000, with marginal relief between these thresholds). After corporation tax, profits can be distributed to shareholders as dividends, which are taxed at lower rates than regular income (8.75% for basic rate taxpayers, 33.75% for higher rate, and 39.35% for additional rate in 2024/25). Directors receiving salaries are subject to income tax and National Insurance through PAYE.

- **Advantages**: Limited liability, separate legal entity, credibility with investors. [[3]](https://www.gardandco.com/what-we-do/business-law/business-articles/sole-trader-partnership-or-limited-company-2/)
- **Disadvantages**: More complex setup and higher administrative costs. [[1]](https://xactaccountants.co.uk/blog/companies-house-fees-changes/), [[2]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z74mmfr/revision/3), [[10]](https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support)

#### 4. Limited Liability Partnership (LLP)
- **Description**: Combines elements of partnerships and limited companies, offering limited liability to partners.
- **Cost (as of may 2024)**:
  - Online registration: £50
  - Same-day online registration: £78
  - Paper registration: £71. [[6]](https://fcls.co.uk/companies-house-fees-increasing-from-1-may-2024/), [[11]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/companies-house-fees/companies-house-fees)
- **Ongoing mandatory costs include:**
   - Annual confirmation statement: £34 online or £62 paper 
   - Company name changes (if needed): £20 online or £30 paper
   - Voluntary dissolution (when closing): £33 online or £44 paper. [[6]](https://fcls.co.uk/companies-house-fees-increasing-from-1-may-2024/)

   While not legally required, an LLP Agreement is strongly recommended to govern the relationship between members. A basic LLP package including a draft agreement costs around £74.99 plus VAT [[12]](https://www.1stformations.co.uk/package/llp/), though more comprehensive bespoke agreements from solicitors can cost considerably more.
- **Taxation Framework:**
   - Unlike limited companies, LLPs are "tax transparent" – the LLP itself doesn't pay tax. Instead, profits are allocated to members who pay income tax and National Insurance on their shares through Self Assessment, similar to a traditional partnership. This avoids the double taxation that can occur with limited companies, though it also means LLP members cannot benefit from the potentially lower dividend tax rates available to company shareholders.
   
- **Advantages**: Flexibility in management and limited liability.
- **Disadvantages**: Requires formal agreements and compliance with Companies House regulations, cannot raise capital by issuing shares like companies [[1]](https://xactaccountants.co.uk/blog/companies-house-fees-changes/), [[2]](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z74mmfr/revision/3).

For our startup inorder to seek scalability and investor confidence, a Limited Liability Company (Ltd.) is the most suitable option due to its liability protection and growth potential


### Which resources do you need and how will you get them?
#### Technological Resources
The business requires significant technological infrastructure to develop and deploy its AI-powered application. This includes:

- AI Model Development: The data science team will develop the machine learning model in-house, utilizing historical and real-time real estate data for training. The plan mentions implementing an AI training pipeline, focusing on collecting and cleaning market data, which suggests in-house capability.

- Application Development: The software development team will design and implement a user-friendly application, likely using standard development tools and frameworks. This is inferred from the need for a user interface allowing property queries and cost predictions.

- Data Collection and Processing Infrastructure: Given the need for real-time updates and daily data feeds from APIs and news sources, the business will require scalable computing power and storage. Cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud are likely choices, offering flexibility and scalability, as seen in industry practices for real estate tech startups [The Financial Technology Report](https://thefinancialtechnologyreport.com/the-top-25-real-estate-technology-companies-of-2024/).

Acquisition Strategy: These resources will be developed in-house where possible, with necessary hardware and software purchased or leased from providers. Cloud services will be subscribed to, ensuring cost-effective scalability.

#### Real Estate Data

The foundation of any Geographic Intelligence platform focused on property price prediction lies in its data infrastructure. For our London-centric platform that combines exceptional UX with ML-powered predictive analytics, addressing the dataset challenge is paramount to delivering accurate insights. Property data forms the cornerstone of our service, and without comprehensive, high-quality datasets, our predictive capabilities would be severely limited. The datasets we require must span historical transactions, geographic boundaries, property characteristics, and contextual information that influences pricing trends across London's diverse neighborhoods.

Property price prediction requires multidimensional data that captures not only basic transaction information but also the nuanced factors that influence real estate valuation. As noted in academic research on London housing price prediction, "various information are provided and can be categorised as follows: ID (Transaction ID), Date, Transaction Price, Property classification (Type, Build, Tenure), and Address information"[[13]](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpd37/theses/2015_beng_aaron-ng.pdf). This diverse data spectrum necessitates a strategic approach to data acquisition and management to ensure our platform delivers accurate predictions and intelligent insights for decision-making.

- Core Dataset Requirements
   - Our platform requires several categories of data resources to power its predictive capabilities. The primary datasets we need include historical property transaction records, comprehensive property attribute information, geographic and spatial data, and contextual market indicators. Each of these components plays a vital role in training our machine learning models to generate accurate property price predictions across London's real estate landscape.

      Historical property transaction data provides the foundation for understanding price movements over time. This includes records of every property sale in London, ideally spanning at least 10-15 years to capture multiple market cycles. Land Registry's Price Paid Data (PPD) offers "information on single residential property sales in England and Wales, sold for value, that are lodged with us for registration"[[14]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-data/public-data). This dataset is crucial as it provides the ground truth for actual market transactions that our models will learn from and attempt to predict.

      Property attribute information helps our algorithms understand the physical and legal characteristics that influence property values. This includes details such as property type (detached, semi-detached, terrace, flat), build status (new or existing construction), tenure (leasehold or freehold), number of bedrooms, and other features that significantly impact property valuation [[13]](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpd37/theses/2015_beng_aaron-ng.pdf). Without these attributes, our prediction models would lack the granularity needed for accurate price estimation.

      Geographic and spatial data provides the critical locational context that is fundamental to real estate valuation. This includes boundary files, postcode data, and polygon information that defines neighborhoods, boroughs, and administrative areas within London. The Ordnance Survey's MasterMap and address data with Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs) are essential resources as they provide "the only official, up-to-date register of all nationally protected historic buildings and sites in England" [[15]](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/data-downloads/). This geographic precision enables our platform to offer location-specific insights through our map-based interface.

- Strategic Data Acquisition Approach
   - The Land Registry provides essential transaction data through their Price Paid Data service, which is "available for use and reuse under the Open Government Licence (OGL)" [[14]](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hm-land-registry-data/public-data). This comprehensive dataset contains historical property sales information that forms the backbone of our price prediction models. We will implement automated data pipelines to regularly download and process updates to this dataset, ensuring our models always incorporate the latest transaction information. The historical depth of this dataset, which extends back to 1995, provides sufficient temporal coverage for identifying meaningful patterns and trends in London's property market [[13]](https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~mpd37/theses/2015_beng_aaron-ng.pdf)

      The Greater London Authority's London Datastore offers additional property transaction details specifically for Greater London, complementing the Land Registry data with more localized information. Their "Housing in London" reports provide "the evidence base for the Mayor's housing policies, summarising key patterns and trends across a wide range of topics relevant to housing in the capital" [[16]](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/housing-london). By incorporating this dataset, we can enrich our models with London-specific housing contexts and policy impacts that influence property values across different boroughs.

      Ordnance Survey data resources, particularly their AddressBase system with Unique Property Reference Numbers (UPRNs), provide the spatial foundation for our geographic intelligence platform. Under the Public Sector Geospatial Agreement, certain OS MasterMap data is now available under open license terms, allowing us to "publish property extents created from OS MasterMap Topography Layer under Open Government Licence (OGL) terms"[[17]](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/products/open-mastermap-programme/opening-up-property-extents). This data will power our map-based interface, enabling users to visualize property price predictions with precise geographical context.

#### Marketing Resources
To reach target customers—real estate agents, property developers, and home buyers/sellers—the business needs effective marketing channels. The plan suggests a B2C approach with subscription models, indicating a need for customer acquisition strategies.
Acquisition Strategy: Marketing channels will be developed through digital strategies, including social media campaigns, content marketing on real estate blogs, and email marketing. Participation in industry conferences and partnerships with real estate associations will enhance visibility, as seen in successful real estate tech startups [Built In NYC](https://www.builtinnyc.com/articles/nyc-real-estate-startups-to-know).

### What are the main risks to the success of your business and how will you address or mitigate them?
The team conducted a PESTLE analysis to identify external factors that may hinder the success of the business.

| Category       | Description  |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Political**  | - The government may impose restrictions on foreign investors purchasing real estate. <br> - Government urban development policies could disrupt AI-based price predictions. <br> - Strengthened immigration restrictions may reduce housing demand in urban areas. <br> - International conflicts may lead investors to withdraw from the market. |
| **Economic**   | - Rising interest rates may increase home-buying costs and lead to declining property prices. <br> - The expansion of remote work may increase property prices in suburban areas. <br> - Economic downturns may drive demand for real estate as a safe-haven asset. |
| **Social**     | - Demand for rental properties may increase over home purchases. <br> - New investment methods (e.g., real estate tokenization) may attract more investors. <br> - Public perception of AI-driven decision-making in real estate. <br> - People's concerns about remote real estate transactions. <br> *(If major fraud cases occur, it could damage the brand's reputation.)* |
| **Technological** | - Real estate tokenization (Failure to adapt may result in losing market competitiveness). <br> - Increasing cybersecurity risks *(Personal data leaks, fraud, hacking of payment systems, blockchain vulnerabilities).* <br> - Growing attention to PropTech → More competitors entering the market. *(Risk of AI prediction programs/systems being copied).* <br> - The accuracy of AI-driven predictions remains uncertain. |
| **Legal**      | - Compliance with GDPR and personal data protection regulations. <br> - The need to ensure transparency and accountability in AI-based prediction models. *(Depending on how it is used, it could be classified as market manipulation).* <br> - Legal risks associated with cross-border transactions and foreign investors. <br> - Potential introduction of new regulations governing AI usage. |
| **Environmental** | - Climate change, natural disasters, and pandemics may lower demand in specific areas. |

### Analysis of Key Business Risks Based on PESTLE Findings

(We will select one of the risks below and provide a detailed discussion, including Mitigation & Contingency Plans.)

**Talent Shortage**
Our business relies heavily on high-value online transactions and foreign investors, requiring robust payment systems and extensive legal and tax-related operations.
A lack of expertise in cybersecurity and legal compliance could lead to regulatory fines and reputational risks.
Additionally, startups face challenges in attracting top talent, making it difficult to secure professionals with specialized knowledge.

**Acquiring the First Customers**
Without acquiring early adopters, the business may fail to gain traction, leading to financial constraints.
Since trust is critical in the real estate industry, a lack of brand recognition could make potential customers hesitant to use the platform.

**Technology Imitation by Competitors**
AI-driven real estate investment tools are gaining attention, and more companies are expected to enter the market.
AI technologies are relatively easy to replicate, making it difficult to establish sustainable competitive differentiation.

**Fraud and Technical Errors Leading to Loss of Trust**
If fraudulent activities occur, the brand’s credibility will be severely impacted, leading to customer attrition.
There is a risk that fraudulent property listings or malicious users could exploit the system, further damaging trust and reputation.
